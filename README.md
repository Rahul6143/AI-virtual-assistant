# 🎙️ AI Voice Assistant

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **voice assistant** built using Python, capable of performing various tasks such as:

- **Answering questions** using WolframAlpha & Wikipedia  
- **Playing YouTube videos** using `pywhatkit`  
- **Fetching real-time information** (news, weather, jokes, etc.)  
- **Speech Recognition & TTS** (WhisperModel + pyttsx3)  
- **Conversational AI** with Google Gemini API  
- **Automating tasks** like opening apps and browsing  

## 🚀 Features
- 🎤 Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts spoken words into text using WhisperModel.
- 🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS): Reads responses aloud using pyttsx3.
- 📚 Wikipedia Search: Fetches and summarizes information from Wikipedia.
- ▶️ YouTube Control: Plays YouTube videos based on voice commands.
- 🧠 WolframAlpha Integration: Answers factual questions.
- 🌐 Web Browsing Automation: Opens web pages based on voice commands.
- 😂 Tells Jokes: Fetches and reads out random jokes.
- 🤖 Google Gemini AI: Generates AI-powered responses.
- ⏰ Time and Date Retrieval: Tells the current time and date.
- 📍 Geolocation Services: Retrieves the user's location details.
